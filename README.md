# PHPUnit Logo Suggestions

During the PHPUnit Code Sprint in Hamburg we came up with the task of finding a (new) logo for PHPUnit. This repository holds ideas, sketches and suggestions for now.

**You can see a gallery of all submissions here: [https://belanur.github.io/phpunit-logo](https://belanur.github.io/phpunit-logo)**

## Licensing

Please note that all rights on the final logo will have to be given to Sebastian Bergmann. See more details on the license discussions in [issue #6](../../issues/6)

## General approach

- it should be flat
- we like the idea of having separate colors for "PHP" and "Unit"
- ideally the logo would contain a reference to code coverage, successfully run tests or similar

## Suggestions

Colors are somewhat off, but I like the checkmark as a sign for a successful test run. The font is Avenir Next Condensed.

![2](suggestions/belanur/logo_2.png)

One line, the `[x]` is a reference to a passed test with testdox output enabled.

Submissions from [Thorsten Frommen](https://github.com/tfrommen):

![7](suggestions/tfrommen/logo_7.png)

The font is Nunito, and the colors are _the PHP color_ as well as the according non-saturated (i.e., monochromatic) variant.

![8](suggestions/tfrommen/logo_8.png)

The font is still Nunito, but I switched to SemiBold (instead of Regular) to make the letters and the checkmark blend better. Colors like before.
