# PHPUnit Logo Suggestions

During the PHPUnit Code Sprint in Hamburg we came up with the task of finding a (new) logo for PHPUnit. This repository holds ideas, sketches and suggestions for now.

## Logo Gallery

**You can see a gallery of all submissions here: [https://belanur.github.io/phpunit-logo](https://belanur.github.io/phpunit-logo)**

## Licensing

Please note that all rights on the final logo will have to be given to Sebastian Bergmann. See more details on the license discussions in [issue #6](../../issues/6)

## General approach

- it should be flat
- we like the idea of having separate colors for "PHP" and "Unit"
- ideally the logo would contain a reference to code coverage, successfully run tests or similar

## Submitting a logo

Before submitting a logo, please be aware that all rights for that 
logo will have to be given to Sebastian Bergmann if it is chosen
as the official PHPUnit logo.
 
To add your suggestion:
1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/belanur/phpunit-logo/fork)
2. Upload your image(s) to the `suggestions/<yourGitHubUsername>/` folder, e.g. `suggestions/johndoe`
3. Add corresponding entries to `docs/_data/submissions.yml` or run `python _updateData.ym` in the `docs/` directory  
You can optionally add a (short!) comment that will be shown on the gallery page. 
4. Create a Pull Request :)

If you are not sure how to do step 3, feel free to omit it and mention that in the Pull Request.
